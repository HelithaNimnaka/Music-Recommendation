**Why both vector and graph databases?**  
This project combines **vector search** (for understanding the meaning, mood, or vibe behind user requests) with a **graph database** (for precise, structured queries about artist, genre, and song relationships). This dual approach enables both flexible, semantic recommendations and accurate, data-driven searches.
